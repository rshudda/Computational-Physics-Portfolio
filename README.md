# Statistical Physics & Complex Systems — Starter Portfolio

**Author:** Ravishankar Hudda  
**Focus:** Computational modelling of emergent behaviour in complex physical systems

This repository contains simple but instructive simulations in statistical physics and complex systems.  
The goal is to build intuition and basic computational skills for a future PhD in **computational and statistical physics**.

## Contents

1. `random_walk/random_walk_1d.ipynb`  
   - 1D random walk of a particle  
   - Position distribution after many steps  
   - Illustration of diffusion-like behaviour

2. `logistic_map/logistic_map.ipynb`  
   - Iteration of the logistic map  
   - Fixed points, period-doubling, and onset of chaos  
   - Bifurcation-style exploration by varying the parameter

3. `monte_carlo_coin/monte_carlo_coin_flip.ipynb`  
   - Monte Carlo estimation of probabilities using repeated coin flips  
   - Law of large numbers and convergence to 0.5  
   - Simple introduction to Monte Carlo ideas

4. `ising_model/ising_model_2d_basic.ipynb`  
   - Very simple 2D Ising model using Metropolis updates  
   - Magnetization vs temperature (qualitative)  
   - Illustration of emergent order from local interactions

## Purpose

These notebooks are not meant to be production-level codes but learning tools.  
They demonstrate that I can:

- Translate physical ideas into simple algorithms  
- Write clear and readable Python code  
- Visualize results and connect them to physical intuition  

This starter portfolio supports my applications for a PhD in **statistical physics, complex systems, and computational modelling**.

## Requirements

- Python 3  
- `numpy`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `jupyter` (for running `.ipynb` notebooks)

You can install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
